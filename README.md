## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise was interesting to see how to use the filters. I need to start paying more attention to the names I add to each element so that it is easy to manage the page.
Finally something very basic clicked :) I really understood what an SPA (single page application) meant. I thought it was only for things that you created an account and things like that but you can create a simple web page with that in mind as well. (I know this is so simple to understand but it just made sense while working on this project. )

I see how useful it is but I know need to understand how the SEO works on this since now I also see how many problems that can cause.

### Continued development

I need to keep working with CSS Grid. Since I was not using it that much I forgot a couple of things and had to look up things. I want to keep working with it, I don't need to remember everything but I really want to understand the very basics needed so that I can create layouts fast.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=1667s) - Taking a look at the about project gave me some ideas on how to approach this.
- [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zBsdzdE4sM) - Since I had not practice css grid for some time I use this video to remind me of the basics.
